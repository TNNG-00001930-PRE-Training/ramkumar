1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

2. With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
Consider use dict()

3. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

4. Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

Hints:
Use __init__ method to construct some parameters

5. Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

6. Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

7. Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

8. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

9. A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1
